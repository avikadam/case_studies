## üìÇ Branch Types

| Branch Type      | Purpose                                                                 |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `master`         | Main branch containing production-ready, reviewed, and tested code.     |
| `feature/*`      | Developer-specific branches for new features or tasks (e.g., Jira IDs). |
| `bugfix/*`       | Branches to fix bugs from the `master`.                                 |
| `release/*`      | Cut from `master` for QA and UAT. Used for pre-release testing.         |

## üîß Workflow Summary

1. Feature/Bugfix Development
    - Create feature/* or bugfix/* from master.
    - Work on your task.
    - Push to remote and raise a Pull Request (PR).
    - Once reviewed and approved, merge into master.

2. Release Preparation
    - Create a release/* branch from master.
    - Build the release and pass it to QA.
    - Same branch is used for UAT.
    - After approval, deploy to production.

3. Post-Deployment
    - Hotfixes (if needed) should also be branched from master as bugfix/* and merged back.
    - Hotfixes should also be merged in release.
    - ReBuild the release and pass it to QA for hotfix testing.
    - Move new build to UAT.
    - After approval, deploy to production.

‚úÖ Notes
- Always pull the latest master before starting any new branch.
- Do not commit directly to master.
- PRs should be peer-reviewed before merging.
